			<p>As stated on the home page, my name is Ethan, but I go by Moody. I'm 22 years old, in college, and working a full time job. I'm going to school for software engineering. I switched my major to this from video and motion graphics in fall of 2016. I've always enjoyed computers for as long as I can remember, so I'm excited to begin this new adventure in life.</p>

			<p>Here are some other random facts about me:<br>
			I'm 6'0 even. I have an INFP personality type. My hair and eye colors are brown and grey, respectively. I love video games, but don't see myself programming my own as a career. I once went on a two week tour to shoot a music video. I live on my own in a small town in Florida. I can't stand living in Florida. My favorite movie is currently Scott Pilgrim vs the World. I play Super Smash Bros. Melee at a competitive level. My favorite game would be Melee, but that would be unfair so I'll say my favorite game of all time is Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. My favorite color is light pink.</p>
