# Stuff I've Worked On

###This website (v0.2)

This website is an experiment with Markdown to make a minimalistic mini-site for myself and a handful of other people.

### Big Picture thumbnails (v16.5.28)

As my curated collection of video games grows larger, I come across many PC games that were released pre-Steam or sans-Steam. That means I have to go through some arbitrary method of adding it to my library. As a Big Picture user, seeing [this](http://i1128.photobucket.com/albums/m495/overlordzombie/1.png) is appalling.

As a solution, I began to download and create my own BP images. You can download the latest version of that collection [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2dbtTzEquEOVlFwU2JVSkVQQVE).
