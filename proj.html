			<h1 class="pinkHead">Cturne Clicker</h1>
			<p>This is a small and simple game that stemmed from not being busy at my office. Click the Dante logo to earn Macca and spend it on demons who will earn more Macca for you automatically.</p>
			<p><a href="http://moodyssbm.github.io/cturne-clicker">Play it here.</a></p>

			<h1 class="pinkHead">Intro to Web Code Examples</h1>
			<p>This is a spot for all my exercises that were completed in the Fall 2016 semester's Intro to Web course. Check out all the examples <a href="http://moodyssbm.github.io/web101">here</a>.</p>

			<h1 class="pinkHead">Pause Command for macOS/Linux</h1>
			<p>This is exactly what it sounds like. A DOS-like pause command for macOS and Linux. This was made out of necessity since my Intro to Programming Concepts professor requires us to use the pause command in our files.</p>
			<p>You can read through how to set it up <a href="./projects/macospause.html">here</a>.</p>

		<div class="blurb">
			<h1 class="pinkHead">Personal Nesbox</h1>
			<p>This was made so that my coworkers and I could easily emulate a handful of games online. You can access it <a href="http://moodyssbm.github.io/personalnesbox">here.</a> Please note that at this time, the "Back" text on the game pages will not work. Just use your browser's back button for the time being.</p>
