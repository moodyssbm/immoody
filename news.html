			<p>This was long, <em>long</em> overdue. I've always enjoyed the aesthetic properties of minimalism, but I've always felt that my site was TOO minimalistic. So I've switched to this new, darker theme. I wanted to keep a minimalistic mindset and stray away from any sort of complext patterns or images, but I wanted to beef up the site as well so that it would feel like I have more content on each page. I'm happy with this grey and pink design if I'm being honest. It didn't take very long, but I'm happy I finally got around to updating the site.</p>
